CAN2

Create and manage a collection of sheet music. I.e. text files with chord patterns, as available from many sources from the internet.

You can also store PDFs (real sheet music) however CAN2 is optimized to deal with text files.

Features:

- connect the chord pattern database to your mp3 database (some other audio formats supported). This gives you opportunity to
 listen to original songs while practising
- Administer Events (e.g. Gigs/Rehearsals). Create a list of pieces to perform/practice
- display mode with auto scroll
- chord recognition and transposing
- advanced copy/paste capabilities
- export songs/collections to pdf
- optionally arbitrary sized pdfs, so no need to turn pages in an electronic pdf viewer
