CAN
===

*Create and manage a collection of sheet music. I.e. text files with chord patterns, as available from many sources from the internet.*

You can also store PDFs (real sheet music) however CAN is optimized to deal with text files.

Features:

- connect the chord pattern database to your mp3 database (some other audio formats supported). This gives you opportunity to
 listen to original songs while practising
- transpose audio files, speed them up or slow them down during playback in realtime
- administer Events (e.g. Gigs/Rehearsals). Create a list of pieces to perform/practice
- display mode with auto scroll
- chord recognition and transposing
- advanced copy/paste capabilities
- export songs/collections to pdf
- export arbitrarily sized pdfs, so every song fits on the page.
- easy git interface to synchronize projects with a git repository (limited functionality for Win32)
- merge editor: perfect to handle multi user editings
